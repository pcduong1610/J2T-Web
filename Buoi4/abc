E. TESTIMONIALS

CLIENT #1

Thank you for your fantastic website designers that

create these website templates. Previously we had

an old style website that rarely made sales or

retained customer loyalty. We have since

redesigned our www.BestPrescription.com website

with your template and have noticed a 100%

increase in sales!

Best Regards, Garry Gnidovitch

CLIENT #2

I have to say that Template Monster is doing an

excellent job! I am using their templates in a Web

design course that I am teaching. Their Templates

are the best I have seen, they are usable,

attractive, and effective.
